## Lets Talk Threads
### Why use ***threads***? ~ (5min)
##### Answer
> 1. Creating a thread goes 10â€“100 times faster than creating a process.
> 2. To shear address space
> 3. Performance
> 4. To work with blocking system calls
> 5. There is a blocking call

### What are threads? ~ (5min)
##### Answer
> One way of looking at a process is that it is a way to group related resources.  A process has an address space containing program text and data and other resources. These resources may include open files, child processes, pending alarms, signal handlers, accounting information, and more. By putting them together in the form of a process, they can be managed more easily. The other concept a process has is a ***thread*** of execution, usually shortened to just ***thread***.  The  ***thread***  has a  program counter that keeps track of which instruc-tion  to  execute  next.   It has  registers,  which  hold  its  current  working  variables.   It has  a  stack,  which  contains  the  execution  history, with  one  frame  for  each  proce-dure  called  but  not  yet  returned  from.  Although  a  ***thread***  must  execute  in  some process,  the  ***thread***  and  its  process  are  different  concepts  and  can  be  treated  sepa-rately.  Processes  are  used  to  group  resources  together;  ***threads***  are  the  entities scheduled for execution on the CPU.

#### What are the differences between processes and threads ~ 5(min)

_Does not have to be exactly like this but make sure that every one gets the difference bewteen threads and processes_

## Race conditions

[Whatch a video about data races](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY9livorrJI)

1. What are race conditions?
2. What is a critical section?

How to spot race conditions?
##### Answear 
```-fsanitize=thread```

Do you see a data race in this code?

```C
//example code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>

void	*rutine(void *ptr)
{
	while (*(int *)ptr < 1000)
	{
		*(int *)ptr += 1;
	}
	printf("Done\n");
	return (NULL);
}

int	main()
{
	pthread_t	thread;
	int		index;

	index = 0;
	pthread_create(&thread, NULL, rutine, &index);
	while (index < 10000)
	{
		index++;
	}
	pthread_join(thread, NULL);
	return (0);

# Bonus

make a program that will use 3 created threads to add up an int to 42. Threads can increment the int every .5sec
once the value is 42 the program has to print "Got it!\n" and exit.

catch:
The threads do not know when the value is 42

What is a monitoring thread?

a monitoring thread is a concept used in the philosopher's project. a monitoring thread will keep track of the int variable. If the value is 42 let the threads know to finish and exit.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

typedef struct	s_data
{
	bool			is_done;
	pthread_mutex_t	mutex_lock;
}				t_data;

void	*rutine(void *ptr)
{
	t_data	*data = ptr;

	while (1)
	{
		pthread_mutex_lock(&data->mutex_lock);
		if (data->is_done)
		{
			printf("I am dead\n");
			pthread_mutex_unlock(&data->mutex_lock);
			return (NULL);
		}
		pthread_mutex_unlock(&data->mutex_lock);
		sleep(1);
		printf("I am still alive\n");
	}
	return (NULL);
}

int	main()
{
	pthread_t		thread[4];
	t_data			data;


	data.is_done = false;
	pthread_mutex_init(&data.mutex_lock, NULL);
	for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
		pthread_create(&thread[i], NULL, rutine, &data);
	sleep(5);
	pthread_mutex_lock(&data.mutex_lock);
	data.is_done = true;
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&data.mutex_lock);
	for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
		pthread_join(thread[i], NULL);
	pthread_mutex_destroy(&data.mutex_lock);
	return (0);
}
