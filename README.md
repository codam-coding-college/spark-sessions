# Spark Sessions

Educational content for the Spark Sessions.

## Why
Students in the first rings of the core curriculum may get overwhelmed by the relatively big complexity of the projects. Spark Sessions aim help with this.

## Spark session PDFs
All the projects in the 42 curriculum are meant to teach a student software development by introducing one or more programming concepts per subject.\
All the Spark Sessions are meant to teach beginning students how to tackle a larger (curriculum) project and splitting its contents in manageable pieces.\
Spark Sessions meant to be a class in how to finish its associated projects. They are meant to teach general design and structure concepts that can be applied to any software project.

## Moderators
Moderator are students that have done, and are very comfortable with the project.
They help to guide the attendees with going through the PDF.
A moderator moderates no more than 5 attendees, as to allow for more personal help and avoiding a "teacher before an class" situation.

The moderator is not a teacher, they may give pointers on where to look for an answer or might correct some misinterpretations. Ideally they can use a attendees' mistake to explain a advise or best practice that applies to all software development.
Every moderator has their own style, some like to do a lot of talking and going through the exercises as an group, some just try to get the attendees to work together and let them figure it out.
