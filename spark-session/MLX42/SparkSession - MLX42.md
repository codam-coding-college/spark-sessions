## Introduction

In case this is your first spark session then a warm welcome!
You might ask yourself: "What is a spark session? What is the point?"

A spark session simply serves as a way of achieving that initial 'spark' for solving on how to complete a certain project. It's goal is not a step-by-step guide / tutorial on how to complete the project.

They main goal is to teach you self sufficiency by showing and giving you tasks that encourage peer-to-peer interactions as well as being able to find the answer on your own.

To achieve this, a spark session composes of bite sized objectives that should help you give an easy footing into solving certain problems. Additionally, spark sessions are a hand-on approach with peer-to-peer in mind, so you will form in groups of 2-3 to work together and solve the following problems.

During the spark-session the moderator's purpose is to clear up confusion and work with the students in answering some but not all questions. They are much like C.A.T's in a way that they can help you with some technical stuff but not with actually solving the problems.

_NOTE: When given an exercise each person should do their own work, however work together to solve problems!_
